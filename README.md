### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Daleon, a full-stack developer who dabbles in IoT, automation, and A.I. I have led teams in e-commerce platforms, single-page applications (SPA's), and some cloud-based apps. Ensuring that the application's UI is stellar for the customer's user experience drove the conversion rate and returned customers to a higher percentile. I primarily work with TypeScript, React, Nextjs, Node.js, Nestjs, and Tailwind, and recently, I have been exploring Rust. I have over five years of experience working with companies within the DFW.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun facts: I skateboard, draw, and do photography [DListPhotos](https://instagram/DListPhotos)

I created products like Tash (A knowledge hub for new hires and existing employees), websites I have worked on include [BackwoodSports](https://backwoodsports.com/), [ThePokePoint](http://thepokepoint.com/), and several more. 
I'm currently looking for new remote opportunities.
