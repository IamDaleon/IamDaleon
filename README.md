### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Daleon. I am a full-stack engineer who dabbles in IoT, automation, and A.I. I have led teams in e-commerce platforms to ensure that the UI for the customer was A+ class, which drove conversion and returning customers. Nowadays, I mostly work with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Tailwind. I have over five years of experience working with companies within the DFW.
