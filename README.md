### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daleon, a full-stack developer passionate about building user-centric applications.  With over 5 years of experience in the DFW area, I've led teams developing e-commerce platforms, single-page applications (SPAs), and cloud-based solutions.  My focus on crafting exceptional UIs has improved conversion rates and customer retention.  Technologically, I'm proficient in TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Nestjs, and Tailwind, and I'm always exploring new horizons like Rust.
